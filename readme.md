1. First you are going to have to install all the packages.
You do this by using the command "npm install", which will automatically install all the packages from the package.json folder.

3. All of the content is split up into components. You can find each component at "src/components".
Once you have adjusted a component to your liking, use the command "npm run dev" which will start the development server and update the website. 

4. To host the website on netlify all you have to do is create an account and either manually upload the files or connect it with your github repo.
Netlify will automatically read the "netlify.toml" file which I have created for you and adjust the settings, so you are good to go from there.

5. All of the images you can find in the src/assets/img folder
For example:
The screenshots file path is: src/assets/img/screenshots

6. If you want to edit css you the file path is: src/assets/css/main.css
Although I suggest to use tailwind classes, as this is the framework I used for the majority of the website.
