# Alva App Tailwind Template
## Free template for an app

1. First you are going to have to install all the packages.
```
npm i
```

3. All of the content is split up into components. You can find each component at "src/components".
Run the following command to update the website and start the development server: 
```
npm run dev
```

4. To host the website on netlify all you have to do is create an account and either manually upload the files or connect it with your github repository.
Netlify will automatically detect the "netlify.toml" file which I have created for you and adjust the settings, so you are good to go from there.

5. All of the images you can find in the src/assets/img folder
> Example: The screenshots file path is src/assets/img/screenshots

6. If you want to edit css you the file path is: 
> src/assets/css/main.css
